          There are a number of things that come to my
          mind when I think of an ideal apartment for myself.
          Firstly, it should be located in a serene and picturesque
          neighborhood and provide a gorgeous view of the city from
          its balcony. It shouldn’t be too far from the heart of the city
          so that it doesn’t take me too long to get to my workplace or to
          a shopping mall. More importantly, it should be located in a safe
          part of the city.
